# autonomous-flight

This repository contains the code and resources related to an autonomous flight project, focusing on image formation in cameras and monocular depth estimation. The goal of the project is to develop algorithms and techniques that enable autonomous drones to perceive and navigate their environment using computer vision.

## Contents

- **Image Formation in Camera**: This folder includes code and materials related to understanding the principles of image formation in cameras. It explores topics such as camera calibration, image distortion correction, and perspective projection.

- **Digital Camera Image Processing**: This folder contains programs and assignments from a university course on digital camera image processing. The programs are implemented in [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and cover foundational concepts in image processing.

- **Monocular Depth Estimation**: This folder includes code and resources for monocular depth estimation. It explores techniques for inferring depth information from a single webcam camera. The folder also includes an added 2017 paper that discusses relevant methodologies in this field.

- **Unsupervised Paper Reviews**: This folder provides an overview of unsupervised learning methods in computer vision. It includes summaries and reviews of relevant research papers in the field.

- **Code/Estimating Distance of Face from Camera**: This folder contains code for estimating the distance of a face from a camera using computer vision techniques. The code utilizes image processing algorithms to estimate depth or distance based on a reference image.

- **Literature Review**: This folder includes a collection of papers and publications related to monocular depth estimation and image processing. The literature review provides valuable insights into state-of-the-art algorithms and advancements in this field.

- **Resources**: This folder contains additional resources, including datasets, tutorials, and relevant articles, to support the understanding and implementation of image processing and depth estimation algorithms.
